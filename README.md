## Integrated R Shiny App with D3 Visualization

This app proposes a simple yet elegant way to visualize tree structures  
with *Shiny* and *D3*

we can use this to control D3 Visualization through R Shiny UI widgets.  


This application expects the following to be installed on your machine:  
*R version 3.3.3*
